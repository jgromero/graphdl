# GraphDL

**GraphDL** is an OWL ontology that allows describing graphs with a simple vocabulary denoting nodes, edges, and properties. It is strongly based on the [Graph Markup Language](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) (GraphML) conceptual model, and therefore can be easily translated into other formats.

 This repository includes the following GraphDL resources:

1. GraphDL ontology model ([ontology](ontology) folder)

2. Java implementation of a GraphDL >> TinkerPop parser ([single-node](single-node) folder)

3. Spark implementation of a GraphDL >> GraphX parser ([distributed](distributed) folder)

There is a web application implementing GraphDL-based graph generation and visualization in Amazon cloud. [insert link here]
